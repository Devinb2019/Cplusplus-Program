Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This particular project was to create a GroceryTracker class to read item data from a file, track frequencies, and provide functionalities regarding that data. The primary problem it solves is organizing and/or analyzing grocery item data.

What did you do particularly well?
I feel as though I organized the code into easily readable functions, had great user interaction, and handled the file efficiently.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could have enchanced my code better through more input validation, error handling and even more comments. The code would make it more readable for changes in the future as well as any bug fixes along the way with those enhancements. 

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging part for myself even though I feel it did it efficiently was the file handling and reading the file initially. I referred back to older projects to figure out how I properly read the file in the past as well as glanced at outside sources for aid.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Many skills used in this project are transferrable. For starters, file handling is often used and vital. The program also fosters user interface designs and menu-driven program which is essential to know across any language or environment.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made my program maintainable, readable, and adaptable through consistent naming and clean indentations and formatting. I also attempted to keep my functions at a reasonabable size that they weren't too much to look at.
